## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned

I learned a lot about how to implement WCAG for multiple needs, I got a great lesson in CSS grid, more experience with flex and responsive design, really wonderful JavsScript basics.

### Continued development

I loved this project and will continue to expand it. I am currently work on making more planets as well as chaning the current planets by using THREE.js for 3d effects.



### Useful resources

- [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/spacetravel) - This helped me with not just the project, but a better understanding of how to implement WCAG standards.
